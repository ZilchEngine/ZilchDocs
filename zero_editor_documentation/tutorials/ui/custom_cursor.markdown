 #  Creating a Custom Mouse Cursor

Making a custom mouse cursor in the Zero Engine is as simple as making a sprite (or a model, or a particle system, etc.) follow the mouse around, and also setting the normal cursor to be invisible. Let's take a custom image and use it as our new cursor.

- Download the following image file:


![PyramidCursor](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/zeroengineteam/ZeroFiles/master/doc_files/106033.png)

- Import it into the project by dragging and dropping it into the `Level Window`
- In the `Group Import Options Window`
 - Under `ImageOptions`
  - Set ImportImages enum to `Sprites`
 - Press the `Import All` button

The apparent "point" of this particular [ SpriteSource](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/blob/master/code_reference/class_reference/spritesource.markdown) is not at its center or one of its corners, so we should adjust its Origin  properties a bit, so that its transform is in just the right spot.

- In the `Library Window`
 - Under the SpriteSource  tag
  - `Double click` `PyramidCursor`
- In the `Sprite Source Editor Window`
 - Set Origin enum to `Custom`
 - Set OriginX  to `7`
 - Set OriginY  to `6`
  ![image](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/zeroengineteam/ZeroFiles/master/doc_files/106349.png)
 - Press the `Save to Sprite Source` button

Now that we have a SpriteSource to use, it's time to make the cursor.

- [ Command](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/blob/master/zero_editor_documentation/zeromanual/editor/editorcommands/commands.markdown) : [ CreateSprite](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/blob/master/code_reference/command_reference.markdown#createsprite)
- In the `Properties Window`
 - Rename Sprite object to `Cursor`
 - Under [ Sprite](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/blob/master/code_reference/class_reference/sprite.markdown)
  - Set SpriteSource enum to `PyramidCursor`

There's a problem here: the main game level's objects are drawn overtop of the cursor. We'll cover how to solve that soon, but let's keep going for now. What we need next is a component that will make this sprite follow the mouse around wherever it moves.

 ##  Moving the Cursor

- [ Command](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/blob/master/zero_editor_documentation/zeromanual/editor/editorcommands/commands.markdown) : [ Add Resource](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/blob/master/zero_editor_documentation/zeromanual/editor/editorcommands/resourceadding.markdown)
 - Create a NadaScript resource using the Component template template and name it `MouseFollower`
- Update the `MouseFollower` script to the following:

```lang=csharp, name="MouseFollower"
class MouseFollower : NadaComponent
{
  [Dependency] var Transform : Transform;
  
  function Initialize(init : CogInitializer)
  {
    Zero.Mouse.Cursor = Cursor.Invisible;
    
    Zero.Connect(this.Space, Events.MouseMove, this.OnMouseMove);
  }
  
  function OnMouseMove(event : ViewportMouseEvent)
  {
    this.Transform.WorldTranslation = event.ToWorldZPlane(0);
  }
}
```

This component will make whatever we attach it to set its position to the world-space coordinates of the mouse whenever the mouse moves. It also sets the mouse cursor to be invisible when it is initialized.

Moving the mouse now brings the cursor sprite with it.

(NOTE) **When the Cursor Comes Back**: You may notice that if you move the mouse so that the cursor leaves the `Game Window`, the default mouse cursor will reappear when you move it back inside. This is a side effect of intended behavior on the part of the Zero Editor; you'll only see it when a project is running in the editor, so it won't happen with exported executables.

- In the `Properties Window`
 - Set Archetype  to `CustomCursor`
- [ Command](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/blob/master/zero_editor_documentation/zeromanual/editor/editorcommands/commands.markdown) : [ Delete](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/blob/master/code_reference/command_reference.markdown#delete)

Now let's fix the fact that the cursor is not drawn on top. The problem is that the cursor is an object in the same space as the other objects in the level, which means it won't necessarily always appear on top of everything, as a proper mouse cursor should. We could move it along the Z axis to put it in front of the sphere, and that would work in this particular case, but it's not a good approach in general. What we really should do is put the cursor in its own space. Let's begin by creating a level for that space, which will contain the cursor (and not much else).

 ##  Cursor Space

- [ Command](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/blob/master/zero_editor_documentation/zeromanual/editor/editorcommands/commands.markdown) : [ Add Resource](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/blob/master/zero_editor_documentation/zeromanual/editor/editorcommands/resourceadding.markdown)
 - Create a Level resource using the {nav icon=clone, name=2D Level} template and name it `CursorLevel`

Just as we learned in the [ tutorial on spaces](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/blob/master/zero_editor_documentation/tutorials/architecture/spaces.markdown), we need to tweak a few settings a bit in this level to ensure that it will layer on top of the main space properly.

- [Select](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/blob/master/zero_editor_documentation/zeromanual/editor/editorcommands/selectobject.markdown) : Renderer object
- In the `Properties Window`
 - Under `ForwardRenderer`
  - Set ClearColor  to `[R:0, G:0, B:0, A:0.00]`



![image](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/zeroengineteam/ZeroFiles/master/doc_files/106157.png)


The renderer's ClearColor  needs to be transparent, or it will be impossible to see the main game level through the overlaid cursor space.

- [Select](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/blob/master/zero_editor_documentation/zeromanual/editor/editorcommands/selectobject.markdown) : GameCamera object
- In the `Properties Window`
 - Under [ CameraViewport](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/blob/master/code_reference/class_reference/cameraviewport.markdown)
  - Set RenderOrder  to `1`
  - Set ForwardViewportEvents checkBox to `true`



![image](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/zeroengineteam/ZeroFiles/master/doc_files/106159.png)


The [ CameraViewport](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/blob/master/code_reference/class_reference/cameraviewport.markdown)'s RenderOrder  in the cursor space needs to be greater than that of the main space so that it will correctly be layered on top. Also, since a mouse-driven game depends on mouse events, we need to make sure we check the ForwardViewportEvents checkBox box. Otherwise, the cursor space would block all of our attempts at mouse interaction from reaching the main space beneath it.

Next, we need a component that, when initialized, will create the cursor space, load the cursor level, and create the custom cursor.

- [ Command](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/blob/master/zero_editor_documentation/zeromanual/editor/editorcommands/commands.markdown) : [ Add Resource](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/blob/master/zero_editor_documentation/zeromanual/editor/editorcommands/resourceadding.markdown)
 - Create a NadaScript resource using the Component template template and name it `CustomCursor`
- Update the `CustomCursor` script to the following:

```lang=csharp, name="CustomCursor"
class CustomCursor : NadaComponent
{
  [Property]
  var CursorLevel : Level = Level.CursorLevel;
  [Property]
  var CursorArchetype : Archetype = Archetype.CustomCursor;
  
  var CursorSpace : Space;
  var Cursor : Cog;
  
  function Initialize(init : CogInitializer)
  {
    this.CursorSpace = this.GameSession.CreateNamedSpace("CursorSpace", Archetype.DefaultSpace);
    this.CursorSpace.LoadLevel(this.CursorLevel);
    this.Cursor = this.CursorSpace.Create(this.CursorArchetype);
    
    Zero.Connect(this.Owner, Events.CogDestroy, this.OnCogDestroy);
  }
  
  function OnCogDestroy(event : ObjectEvent)
  {
    if (this.CursorSpace != null)
      this.CursorSpace.Destroy();
  }
}
```

When this component is initialized, it creates the cursor space and loads the cursor level into it, then creates the custom cursor in that level. (It also has a handy reference to the cursor, which you can access in case you want to manipulate it at runtime in another script.) When the cog it is attached to is destroyed, it destroys the cursor space. We'll attach it to the LevelSettings object object in the main space, so that the cursor will be created as soon as the game begins.

(NOTE) **Why Destroy?** In this tutorial's game, we're attaching the `CustomCursor` to the LevelSettings object object in the main space, which is created when the level is loaded and destroyed when it ends. Thus, the cursor space will exist for as long as the main space does. So why should we bother to destroy it explicitly when the LevelSettings object is destroyed? The answer is that if were to make a game with some levels that use the mouse with a custom cursor and some that don't, we would be switching back and forth as we load levels. This is a convenient way to make the component that creates the space clean up after itself in a manner that ensures that the custom cursor is present only when it's needed, and that we don't unwittingly create duplicates of it.

- In the `Library Window`
 - Under the Level  tag
  - Open the `Level` Level resource
- [ Select](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/blob/master/zero_editor_documentation/zeromanual/editor/editorcommands/selectobject.markdown) : LevelSettings object
- In the `Properties Window`
 - [ Add Component](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/blob/master/zero_editor_documentation/zeromanual/editor/addremovecomponent.markdown) : `CustomCursor`

We're finally done! Let's see it all together.

- [ Command](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/blob/master/zero_editor_documentation/zeromanual/editor/editorcommands/commands.markdown) : [ PlayGame](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/blob/master/code_reference/command_reference.markdown#playgame)
 - Move the mouse to make the custom cursor move.
