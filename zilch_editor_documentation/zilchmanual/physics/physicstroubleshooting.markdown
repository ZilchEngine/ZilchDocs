Why do objects sometimes pass right through each other when moving too fast?

 #  [Edge Catching](https://github.com/ZilchEngine/ZilchDocs/blob/master/zilch_editor_documentation/zeromanual/physics/physicstroubleshooting/edgecatching.markdown)
An object seems to get stuck occasionally. What is this and how is it fixed?
